## Overview
This folder contains my applied projects from **ANLT‑202: Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, showcasing my ability to build, evaluate, and tune predictive models.  
The projects emphasize **supervised learning, regression, neural networks, and model evaluation** using Python.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit‑learn)  
- **Frameworks:** Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow/Keras (introductory)  
- **Concepts:** Classification, Regression, Model Tuning, Neural Networks

## Projects
### 1. Classification Models
- Implemented logistic regression and decision trees.  
- Compared baseline vs. tuned models using accuracy and F1 score.

### 2. Regression Analysis
- Predicted continuous outcomes (e.g., used car prices).  
- Evaluated with RMSE and R² metrics.

### 3. Model Tuning & Evaluation
- Applied hyperparameter tuning and cross‑validation.  
- Explored bias‑variance trade‑offs.

### 4. Deep Learning Intro
- Built a simple neural network for image recognition.  
- Compared performance with traditional ML models.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands‑on experience with **ML pipelines**.  
- Strengthened **data preprocessing and visualization** skills.  
- Practiced **model evaluation and tuning**.  
- Connected ML concepts to **healthcare and youth‑centered applications**.
