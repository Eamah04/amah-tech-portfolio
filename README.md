# amah-tech-portfolio
Hi, I’m **Emmanuel Amah** — **Registered Nurse | Business Information Systems Student | Aspiring Cloud & Systems Developer**.  

I bring a unique blend of **healthcare expertise** and **technical training**. With years of experience as a Registered Nurse, I’ve developed a strong foundation in **evidence-based, human-centered care**. Now, through my Business Information Systems program at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, I’m expanding that foundation into **cloud computing, software development, and machine learning**.  

This portfolio highlights selected projects that demonstrate my ability to:  
- Design and deploy **scalable cloud workflows**.  
- Build **robust Java applications** grounded in solid computer science fundamentals.  
- Apply **machine learning models** to solve real-world problems.  

My goal is to bridge **technology and healthcare**, creating systems that are not only technically sound but also improve access, efficiency, and outcomes for people.
